%        A = FITELLIPSE(X,Y) returns the parameters of the best-fit
%        ellipse to 2D points (X,Y).
%        The returned vector A contains the center, radii, and orientation
%        of the ellipse, stored as (Cx, Cy, Rx, Ry, theta_radians)

% This is a more bulletproof version than that in the paper, incorporating
% scaling to reduce roundoff error, correction of behaviour when the input
% data are on a perfect hyperbola, and returns the geometric parameters
% of the ellipse, rather than the coefficients of the quadratic form.
